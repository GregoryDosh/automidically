# AutoMIDIcally

This is no-where near ready for use yet, but the idea is to be able to control the windows volume sliders for individual applications/devices using real hardware sliders on a MIDI device. I was frustrated with "Power Mixer" disconnecting from my MIDI device and just generally misbehaving and being way more than I really wanted to have for simply mapping a fader to an application.

## Future Ideas
Going to be also looking into triggering automation/scripts/hooks into other applications using MIDI buttons too.
Reuse existing hardware to replicate a stream deck like setup.
